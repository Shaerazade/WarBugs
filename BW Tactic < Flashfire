Hi all Dev-team,

i'm south French player, live player.

i noticed some fixes on 'Flashfire tactic' u made already but.. did u really expect 'BW to cast while moving' ?

i noticed recently that when Flashfire procs => Build-time is reduced by 50% instead of tooltip => instant cast

But the point is that i can 'cast while Moving', i checked forum and chit-chat post but can't find any related talks so here i post a report
know if it is attempted or smallfixes classed fact, or correct report to improve the Project.

it will be very hard to screen it, vid√©o sound better but i lack skills/tools for that.

Tyvm for answer et matter on the post.
